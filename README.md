A [Logo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logo_(programming_language)) interpreter for the [Internet Computer](https://dfinity.org), written in [Motoko](https://dfinity.org/faq/what-is-motoko).

# Goal

The goal is to explore the following:
- Customization of Candid UI library; Animation on the Internet Computer
- Incrmental computation with different requirements from SAC/Adapton, e.g. Output delta result (no in-place update); Focus on efficient support for collection types; No support for general recursion; No need for memoization
- Realizing Bret Victor's idea on [Inventing on Principle](https://vimeo.com/36579366)

So yes, the prefix "ic" represents these three things: Internet Computer, Incremental Computation and Interactive Computing.
